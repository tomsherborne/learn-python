    "Python is a program on your computer like many others, the program takes instructions in the form of code and executes the instructions to the best of the program's ability. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some programming languages like C++ turn code into binary, ones and zeroes, which is called \"compiling\". But Python works in a different way. When you write code in Python, this is an input into the Python program, which has what is called an \"interpreter\" to turn your code into \"machine code\". You might hear Python being called an \"Interpreted language\" because of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python interpreter, or \"shell\", uses REPL logic. REPL stands for \"Read/Evaluate/Print\". You write code, the program reads the code, checks that everything is correct according to the specific syntax of Python and then prints and executes the commands. \n",
